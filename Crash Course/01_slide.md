# History Lesson

* In March 2017, a videogame titled PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds was released
  by Bluehole into Steam's Early Access program.
* PUBG quickly garnered a massive playerbase and racked up 20+ million sales.
  Continues to be the game with the highest number of concurrent users
  **on Steam** by far (around half a million).
* Epic Games released their Battle Royale mode into their Early Access game
  Fortnite in September 2017. The game essentially set the world on fire, now
  boasting over 45 million players and averaging 3 million concurrent users.
* These two games are now considered the defacto games in the Battle Royale
  genre, pushing out all of their predecessors and basically ensuring future
  entries in the genre will have massive trouble getting traction.

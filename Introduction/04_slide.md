# What is Rotisserie?

* webapp for passively viewing active streams of battle royale games on twitch.tv.
* borrows from NFL RedZone concept/tv channel.
* Application engine written entirely in node.js.
* OCR engine written in Python and leverages TensorFlow (more on that later),
  but previously used Tesseract (and was unreliable).
* currently only focuses on PlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds, but it will
  incorporate Fortnite soon enough.
